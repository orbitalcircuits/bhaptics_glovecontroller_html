## Getting Started
This software is designed to vibrate the fingers of the [bHaptics TactGloves](https://www.bhaptics.com/shop/tactglove) in a random pattern, repeating each finger several times before a brief duration of no vibration.

### Prerequisites
On a Windows PC, install the [bHapticsPlayer](https://www.bhaptics.com/support/downloads).  
Skip any wizard dialogs and warnings about using the provided bluetooth dongle, as the gloves do not come with one.  
Instead use the bluetooth built-in to your computer or your own bluetooth dongle. 

Pair and connect to the gloves using the bHapticsPlayer, using the Devices menu.  
After pairing the gloves, use the "Feedback Test" to verify the gloves are working properly.  
If having difficulty getting gloves to respond after pairing them, try exiting bHapticsPlayer (using the system tray to make sure it is completely closed) and restarting it from the Start Menu.

### Installation
Download [glove_controller.html](https://rawcdn.githack.com/orbitalcircuits/glovecontroller/fa1b6d32c5878fa64d8adec18c23666e09101bed/glove_controller.html) by right-clicking the link and selecting "Save Link As..."  
Save it somewhere convenient on your PC to open later.

### Running
Ensure the bHapticsPlayer is running in the background.  
Open your local copy of [glove_controller.html](https://rawcdn.githack.com/orbitalcircuits/glovecontroller/fa1b6d32c5878fa64d8adec18c23666e09101bed/glove_controller.html) file in a browser.  
Make sure to keep the page in the foreground (do not open other tabs in the same browser window) because the browser will throttle the background tabs and cause the vibration to pause or stop.
